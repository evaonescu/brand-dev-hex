      <h2 style="text-align: justify; color:white">Marketing</h2>
      <h4 class="mt-4" style="text-align: justify; color:white">Context of campaign and promotional activities</h4>
      <p style="text-align: justify; color:white">Our Social Media campaign's goal was tocreate visibility for our brand on the market by reaching the right audience, making them aware about our products and activities and connecting to them on a more personal level. Our message stays in our motto, which is also the first triad we posted on social media: "Inspire.Aspire. Connect". This speaks about our mission: we want to inspire people to be themselves and allow them to inspire each other, give them wings to be the best and most free version of themselves that they are aspiring to be, and lastly, connect with each other and with us through our community.&nbsp; This is what our campaign strives to do, and thus we picked 3 social media platforms: Instagram, TikTok and Discord.</p>
      <p style="text-align: justify; color:white">Instagram was our main visual platform, where we shared images fitting for our colors and values and shared teasers for the launch of our brand, as well as exciting information about our community and plans. The way we went about posting was in triads - meaning consistent lines of 3 posts for a more aesthethic atmoshphere (examples are attached at the bottom of the page). In vibrand splashes of color we introduces who we are, our vision, mission, and many call-to-action and thoughtful posts. We also shared reels that were posted on TikTok as well, trying to keep up with the most recent trends - a thing that proves succesful. Some of our posts were mostly adressed questions directly to the users to create a sense of dialogue, a connection between our brand and them, and also to appeak to their emotions, making them associate the empowerment of our brand with good-feels.&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;</p>
      <p style="text-align: justify; color:white"> For a better reach, we also used hashtags. They are facilitating searches and increasing our chances of visbility.</p>

		<h2 style="text-align: justify; color:white">Reach objectives</h2>
<h5 style="text-align: justify; color:white">Reach: Across all social media platforms together increase our brand’s reach up to 5000 people by the 21st of April 2022.</h5>
		<p style="text-align: justify; color:white"> &nbsp;We ultimatelt had a concrete reach of 2,962 from the raw data, plus additions explained below.</p>
		<h5 style="text-align: justify; color:white">We will not be using paid promotion, so we are aiming for Instagram reach of 3000.</h5>
		<p style="text-align: justify; color:white"> Our final reach was 1,304 as of 19th of April. However, we forgot to turn our profile to a business one for our first 6 posts, resulting in the loss of the data for those posts. Our average reach per picture was around 50, and 150 per video. This being said, we approximate an additional 50*5 + 150*2 people =&gt; 550 extra people, resulting in a final reach of 1854 people. This being said, we did not reach our Instagram goal.</p>
		<h5 style="text-align: justify; color:white"> We will not be using paid promotion, so we are aiming for a TikTok reach of 2000.</h5>
	  <p style="text-align: justify; color:white"> Our final reach was 1,658 until the 19th of April. However, we had already posted content before turning on our "Analytics" function, thus we could not see our real complete reach, that would have probably help us reach our goal, since we noticed our videos has a reach between 100-800 people, resulting in an average of approximately 300 people reached per video. Thus, we consider that we have reached our TikTok goal.&nbsp;</p>
		
		<h2 style="text-align: justify; color:white">Explanation of chosen platforms</h2>

	  <p style="text-align: justify; color:white">As it is already mentioned in the “Media Tactics” chapter from the Justification Document, the platforms we picked for our Media Campaign were Instagram, TikTok and Discord. As it has resulted from our campaign, the choices were right for our target audience. However, we learnt a lot from our insights, as on TikTok we have mostly reached an audience consisting of females, but our brand has no gender. We have, thankfully, reached an international audience from several countries, just as our target audience.&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;</p>
