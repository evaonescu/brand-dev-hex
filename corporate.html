      <h2 style="text-align: justify; color:white">Marketing</h2>
      <h4 class="mt-4" style="text-align: justify; color:white">Context of campaign and promotional activities</h4>
      <p style="text-align: justify; color:white">Our Social Media campaign's goal was to create visibility for our brand on the market by reaching the right audience, making them aware about our products and activities and connecting to them on a more personal level. Our message stays in our motto, which is also the first triad we posted on social media: "Inspire.Aspire. Connect". This speaks about our mission: we want to inspire people to be themselves and allow them to inspire each other, give them wings to be the best and most free version of themselves that they are aspiring to be, and lastly, connect with each other and with us through our community.&nbsp; This is what our campaign strives to do, and thus we picked 3 social media platforms: Instagram, TikTok and Discord.</p>
      <p style="text-align: justify; color:white">Instagram was our main visual platform, where we shared images fitting for our colors and values and shared teasers for the launch of our brand, as well as exciting information about our community and plans. The way we went about posting was in triads - meaning consistent lines of 3 posts for a more aesthethic atmoshphere (examples are attached at the bottom of the page). In vibrand splashes of color we introduces who we are, our vision, mission, and many call-to-action and thoughtful posts. We also shared reels that were posted on TikTok as well, trying to keep up with the most recent trends - a thing that proves succesful. Some of our posts were mostly adressed questions directly to the users to create a sense of dialogue, a connection between our brand and them, and also to appeak to their emotions, making them associate the empowerment of our brand with good-feels.&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;</p>
      <p style="text-align: justify; color:white"> For a better reach, we also used hashtags. They are facilitating searches and increasing our chances of visbility.</p>
      <p style="text-align: justify; color:white">TikTok was the place where we mostly posted enterntaining content that alled for all the creatives to join our community and submit their designs. Hashtags, call-to-actions and a linktree towards our socials in the bio helped us get closer to our goal. Details about the posts can be found in our context calendar.</p>
      <p style="text-align: justify; color:white">Discord was an element that we did not priortize a lot, due to the fact that its use only started after we reached a certain number of people, as it is a platform used to connect and communicate rather than to reach the early adopters. Details can be found in our content calendar.&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<h5 style="text-align: justify; color:white">Profile Grid</h5>
		<ol style="text-align: justify; color:white">
			<li>Our first triad included our motto along with the colors of our brand and a "#" symbol made from the legs of two sneaker enthusiasts. The text of the photos was catchy and short, meant to intriguie and attract the audience. The visuals reflected the personality of our brand and proved successful.&nbsp;&nbsp;</li>
			<li>The next triad consists of a funny image that shows our brand's vision in a graffit, and 2 videos that complete each other and contain a call-to-action question for people to commen. Additionally it also advertises how effective our product is in sharing art.&nbsp;</li>
			<li>This triad consisted of 2 rhetorical questions about the users' struggles that are framing an exciting video about self-expression.&nbsp;</li>
			<li>We posted 3 videos that are&nbsp;exhortations for the users to get out of their comfort zone with the help of our brand.&nbsp;&nbsp;</li>
			<li>This triad was a grid of posts in the color of our brand inclusing a teaser fo our launch, an inspirational message to help our users get out of their comfort one and break free with the help of our brand, and an encouragement to be themselves and let their creativity flow.</li>
			<li>This highly visual triad with a cutting-edge and mysterious vibe that includes rhetorical questions is meant to appeal to the users' emotions and help them connect with our brand.&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;</li>
			<li>This trial of reels had a great reach thanks to its fun and sunny vibe.&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;</li>
			<li>This triad bring forth a joyful vibe with splashes of color to reflect that we will launch our brand with a boom, and we are ready to spread our good vibes.</li>

		</ol>
		<h5 style="text-align: justify; color:white">Stories</h5>
		<ol style="text-align: justify; color:white">
		<li>
		Our first story was one of our reels, meant to promote our feed	
		</li>
		<li>
		Our second story was the post we created for our content soft-sell ad. This story was accompanied by fitting music and had a good reach for our audience.
		</li>
		</ol>
		<h5 style="text-align: justify; color:white">Reels</h5>
		<p style="text-align: justify; color:white"> The reels we posted were all videos we posted on our TikTok, following trends that were at their peak, and thus had a great success.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
		<h2 style="text-align: justify; color:white">Reach objectives</h2>
<h5 style="text-align: justify; color:white">Reach: Across all social media platforms together increase our brand’s reach up to 5000 people by the 21st of April 2022.</h5>
		<p style="text-align: justify; color:white"> &nbsp;We ultimately had a concrete reach of 2,962 from the raw data, plus additions explained below.</p>
		<h5 style="text-align: justify; color:white">Instagram reach of 3000.</h5>
		<p style="text-align: justify; color:white"> Our final reach was 1,649 as of 19th of April. However, we forgot to turn our profile to a business one for our first 6 posts, resulting in the loss of the data for those posts. Our average reach per picture was around 50, and 150 per video. This being said, we approximate an additional 50*5 + 150*2 people =&gt; 550 extra people, resulting in a final reach of 2,199 people. This being said, we did not reach our Instagram goal.</p>
		<h5 style="text-align: justify; color:white"> TikTok reach of 2000.</h5>
	  <p style="text-align: justify; color:white"> Our final reach was 2,708 until the 19th of April. However, we had already posted content before turning on our "Analytics" function, thus we could not see our real complete reach, that would have probably help us go beyond our goal. We noticed our videos has a reach between 100-800 people, resulting in an average of approximately 300 people reached per video. Thus, we consider that we have (over) reached our TikTok goal.&nbsp;</p>
		<h5 style="text-align: justify; color:white"> Discord reach of 30.</h5>
	  <p style="text-align: justify; color:white"> We only managed to reach 10% of this goal sadly, but have learnt from this expereince and will elaborate in the further sections.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
		<h2 style="text-align: justify; color:white">Explanation of chosen platforms</h2>

	  <p style="text-align: justify; color:white">As it is already mentioned in the “Media Tactics” chapter from the Justification Document, the platforms we picked for our Media Campaign were Instagram, TikTok and Discord. As it has resulted from our campaign, the choices were right for our target audience. However, we learnt a lot from our insights, as on TikTok we have mostly reached an audience consisting of females, but our brand has no gender. We have, thankfully, reached an international audience from several countries, just as our target audience. We also concluded that videos have the most impact when trying to reach out to a new audience.&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;</p>

<h2 class="mt-4" style="text-align: justify; color:white">Learning Points</h2>
		<h5 style="text-align: justify; color:white">What worked</h5>
		<ul style="text-align: justify; color:white">
		  <li> During our early activity, thanks to the members of our team conducting intense promotion og HEX on our own social media accounts, a great number of the early followers consisted of friends, family, and university collegues. This helped disseminate the brand towards the friends of their friends and so on. Thus, we could say we had a "word-of-mouth" approach at the beginning of our campaign.</li>
			<li> Our first reel had an immense reach compared to the other posts, which proved to us that videos have the greatest success when trying to reach a new audience.</li>
			<li> Using bold colors and visually appealing images helped with attracting the young creative audience, as they have short attention spans but are easily allured by aesthetically pleasing posts.</li>
			<li>Our TikTok videos had a huge reach right from the start, thus our goal was easily met. We learnt that TikTok is one of the best platforms that a brand can use for the kickstart of its activity because using trending sounds and following popular trends proves extremely efficient in spreading the video.&nbsp;We think the hashtags helped, but were not thekey ingredient in our success, but rather the sounds and the pleasant visuals. This proved our strategy was correct.</li>
			<li>After our initial surge of followers gained thanks to our word-of-mouth marketing, the number stagnated on Instagram and getting new followers proved more difficult than we initially thought, especially without paid promotion. In addition, although we had a great TikTok reach actually making people follow our page was no easy task, as not many choose to follow on TikTok, due to mostly watching videos from the "for you page"</li>
		  </ul>
	
		<h5 style="text-align: justify; color:white">What did not work as planned</h5>
		<ul style="text-align: justify; color:white">
		<li>
Discord - We do not intend to be active on Discord until the last week before the deadline. The purpose of Discord as we mentioned before is not to bring visibility but to inform our customers or future ones about the new designs and benefits and to create authentic connection&nbsp; that can be later done after we get the visibility needed through Instagram and TikTok. However, we only got 10% of our reach goal. We have concluded that the reason for that was a lack of proper social media advertisement of the Discord community through visuals - people rarely go into detail to read the descriptions of the photos, they need to see.</li>
	  </ul>
      <h2 class="mt-4" style="text-align: justify; color:white">Future Planning</h2>
      <p style="text-align: justify; color:white">Looking back on HEX's marketing campaign, we can prouly say we have gained several insights on creating a more succesful future campaign. Here are a few things we would change:</p>
     <ul style="text-align: justify; color:white">
		<li>Conduct more research into the type of content our target audience wants to see and try to diversify our posts more.</li>
		 <li>Create more reels, and produce them at a higher quality, since reels are the best in reaching new audiences, and the better the video, the more people it attracts.</li>
		 <li>Create platform-specific content, although reposting TikToks on Instagram is time-efficient.</li>
		 <li>Post consistently.</li>
		 <li>Create more stories ad they help with engagement.</li>
		 <li>Plan better in advance, and make sure we activate the proper creator tools for analytics.</li>
		 <li>Collaborate with other brands or influencers.</li>
		 <li>Do not count on the posts' texts for information, include the most important things in the pictures themselves.</li>
		
		
		</ul>
